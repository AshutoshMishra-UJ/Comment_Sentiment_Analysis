## 🎤 For Interview - Detailed Project Explanation

### Project Overview
"I developed an end-to-end YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis system that demonstrates comprehensive MLOps practices. The project analyzes YouTube comments to classify sentiments in real-time through a production-ready API."

### Technical Architecture

**1. Data Pipeline**:
- Implemented data ingestion with 80-20 train-test split
- Built preprocessing pipeline with text cleaning, lemmatization, and stopword removal (retaining sentiment-relevant words like 'not', 'but')
- Applied TF-IDF vectorization with optimized parameters (10K features, 1-3 grams)

**2. Model Development**:
- Selected LightGBM for its efficiency with high-dimensional sparse data
- Performed hyperparameter tuning: 367 estimators, learning rate 0.09, max depth 20
- Integrated MLflow for experiment tracking, comparing multiple model configurations
- Achieved robust classification with comprehensive evaluation metrics

**3. MLOps Infrastructure**:
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow server tracking all experiments, parameters, and metrics
- **Data Version Control**: DVC managing datasets with S3 remote storage
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Automated 5-stage DVC pipeline (ingestion → preprocessing → building → evaluation → registration)
- **Model Registry**: MLflow model registry for versioning and stage transitions (Staging → Production)

**4. Deployment**:
- Built Flask REST API with 4 endpoints: prediction, batch prediction, word cloud generation, temporal analysis
- Implemented CORS for cross-origin requests
- Containerized with Docker for consistent deployment
- Configured AWS infrastructure: EC2 for hosting, S3 for storage, CodeDeploy for automated deployment
- Set up CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions

**5. API Endpoints**:
- `POST /predict`: Single comment sentiment prediction
- `POST /predict_with_timestamps`: Batch predictions with temporal data
- `GET /wordcloud`: Generate sentiment-based word cloud visualizations
- `GET /sentiment_over_time`: Time-series sentiment analysis

### Challenges Overcome

1. **High-Dimensional Sparse Data**: Used LightGBM which efficiently handles TF-IDF sparse matrices
2. **Preprocessing Optimization**: Balanced stopword removal to retain sentiment-critical negations
3. **Model Versioning**: Integrated MLflow registry for seamless model lifecycle management
4. **Deployment Pipeline**: Automated deployment with DVC, Docker, and AWS CodeDeploy

### Business Impact
"This system enables real-time sentiment analysis of user engagement, helping content creators and businesses understand audience reactions. The MLOps pipeline ensures reproducibility, scalability, and easy model updates based on new data."
